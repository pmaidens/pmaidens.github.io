  <p>My name is Peter Maidens. I am a father, a passionate maker, and a dedicated software developer. I love making things, and getting deeply invested in cool new projects where I get to learn new things.</p>
  
  <p>I live in Edmonton, Alberta with my three amazing children, my brilliant wife, our lovable yellow Labrador Retriever, and our spunky Bassett Hound. When I am not busy making memories with my family, you can find me tinkering away to learn something new. Some of my super nerdy hobbies that I spend my time exploring include 3D printing, tabletop roleplaying, painting miniatures, and coding!</p>
  
  <p>Feel free to look around, I would love to connect and get to know you! My site is always evolving, so don't forget to check back soon.</p>
  
  <p>Cheers!</p>
