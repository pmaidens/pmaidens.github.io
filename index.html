                    The only way you could accuse me of being a work-a-holic,
                    would be by counting my family as a job; I love spending
                    time with my family! I have a <span id="age1"></span>
                    year old son whom I am super proud of, an adorable
                    <span id="age2"></span> month old daughter,
                    a beautiful and loving wife, and an energetic
                    yellow labrador retriever. My family is great at keeping me
                    on my toes; it is never a dull moment around our house. Our
                    family motto is: <i>You don't need to be crazy to live here;
                    we'll train you</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To me, work-life balance is crucial. I love my job, and I
                    love my family. I think personal growth is
                    important, and my career and my family life each give me
                    different ways to grow. Growing in these two different
                    spaces has allowed me to become a well-rounded person. If you are
                    looking for someone who will work 140 hours a week and live
                    out of a van in the parking lot, move on to the next
                    candidate. However, if you are looking for someone who has
                    great interpersonal skills, values other people's time, has
                    strong leadership experience, and has programming skills to
                    boot, keep on reading!

                            I spent 20 months working on Quickbooks Online at Intuit
                            in their Edmonton office. The cheesy saying "<i>Everything
                            I know, I learned from _____</i>" is the perfect way to
                            describe how I learned to program. In the short time
                            that I was there, I learned more than I did during my
                            entire bachelor's degree. I learned a ton about good
                            programming practices, the web, and developing software
                            in teams.

                        <p>
                        	At Intuit, I worked on a team developing Quickbooks
                            Online using cutting edge technology. Through this
                            experience, I learned the ins and
                            outs of web application development. I contributed to
                            the Single Page Application frontend and developed
                            RESTful backend services. Scalability is always a
                            concern when developing applications for over 1 million
                            users, and my work on QBO taught me how to
                            develop software in a scalable way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Intuit also taught me a lot about teamwork. Hundreds of
                            developers work on QBO, and scrum teams were
                            often swarming around a single task. This meant that
                            good communication with people on your team, as well as
                            people across the globe was critical. I also learned how
                            to communicate with different stake holders, such as
                            customers, project managers, directors, and others.
                            These lessons helped me grow as a person and become a
                            better software developer because it allows me to
                            increase the quality and efficiency of my work.

                        <h4>Full-time Software Developer</h4>
                        <p>
                            After completing my bachelor's degree, I returned to Intuit to work as a
                            full time software developer. Since then, I have learned
                            an awful lot! I am currently working as the Scrum Master
                            for first time use. Our team has made significant
                            improvemnts to the product in a very short period of time,
                            and I am super proud of the work that we did. If you
                            want to see our work, sign up for a free trial of QuickBooks
                            Online; the portion I worked on is the setup interview.
                            While I can't tell you an exact dollar figure of the impact
                            our team had (sorry, trade secret), I can tell you that
                            it was enough that I could have retired with it.

                    <h4>Bachelor's of Science - Specialization in Computing Science</h4>
                    <h5>Minor in Business</h5>
                    <p>
                        The university helped me grow in two ways. First, my degree
                        gave me the foundation of my knowledge of computing science.
                        I had the opportunity to learn from world class professors
                        and broaden my understanding of computing science. I
                        learned everything from RSA encryption on an
                        <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction">Arduino</a>
                        (that was actually the first program I ever wrote) to
                        Map-Reduce on an eight node distributed system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, my minor in business gave me the opportunity
                        to develop business, leadership, and interpersonal skills.
                        With my business courses, I focused on topics surrounding
                        leadership and entrepreneuship, which gave me great exposure
                        to important topics for any business, such as team building
                        and how to innovate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even after graduating with my bachelor's degree, I continue
                        to be curious and look to learn wherever I can.

                    <h4>Lead Event Technician and Sales Associate</h4>
                    <p>
                        I'm often told that I shouldn't include a sales job on my
                        resum&#233 because it isn't relevant. Frankly, I think the
                        people who tell me that are under valuing the experience
                        that a job in sales gives you. In my experience, there were
                        three main areas where I grew a lot thanks to my work in
                        retail that continue to apply to my career today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, I developed really strong interpersonal
                        skills such as communication and teamwork. From my
                        experience, retail customers come in all sorts of
                        backgrounds, moods, and temperaments. As a result, I
                        quickly learned how to deal with all sorts of people and how
                        to communicate appropriately in many different situations.
                        I also learned how to work effectively in a team, including
                        times when I was responsible for leading a large groups.
                        During off-site events, I was often responsible for
                        coordinating an entire events team, as well as groups of
                        participants as large as 150 people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, I developed a deep appreciation for customers.
                        Working in such close proximity to customers and helping
                        them solve the problems they were experiencing gave me a
                        deep understanding and appreciation for the importance of
                        customers to any business; it allowed me to understand the
                        importance of focusing on the customer. I learned that a
                        company must adapt on the customer's perspective in order to
                        adapt and solve the customer's pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I learned what my values are, and how to stick to
                        them. Sales people have a reputation of being selfish and
                        conniving, but that's not who I am. I learned that I can
                        stand by my core values of honesty, trust, and respect, and
                        still be an effective sales person. By standing by my values
                        and not stooping to immoral sales tactics, I reinforced my
                        confidence and my moral fortitude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The days of software developers sitting in a cubicle
                        all alone are over; software development has more of a team
                        activity than most other careers. The soft skills that I
                        developed while working sales are an invaluable part of
                        my skill set, and make me a significantly more effective
                        team member and programmer.

                Well, if you are looking for someone to build you a simple
                website, you are probably better off talking to a graphic
                designer (it will probably take them less time and cost you
                less). However, if you want to build a large scale web
                application, you have come to the right place. I have a ton of
                experience creating large-scale, efficient, web-based
                applications, and I would love to talk with you about the
                project you are working on!
